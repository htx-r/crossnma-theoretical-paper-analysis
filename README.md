A few points to consider when running the analysis:
1. The analysis can only be performed on antidepressants example as the dataset is available.
2. The analysis should begin in the run_analysis folder because we could not put all JAGS ouput in GitHub repository - large files.
3. The analysis for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) cannot be run because the data is unavailable. However, some of its JAGS output is available in the folder output\RRMS\JAGS and can be used to produce the figures and tables in scripts; numbers_in_Results_section.R, produce_appendix_plots_tables.R and produce_maintext_plots_table.R
