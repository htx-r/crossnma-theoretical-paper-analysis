A few points to consider when running the analysis:
1. The analysis can only be performed on antidepressants example as the dataset is available.
2. The analysis should begin in the run_analysis folder because we could not put all JAGS ouput in GitHub repository - large files.
3. The analysis for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) cannot be run because the data is unavailable.
